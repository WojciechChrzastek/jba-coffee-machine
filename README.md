# Coffee machine

## About the project

The project is designed by [JetBrains Academy](https://www.jetbrains.com/academy/) and realised as a part of [Java Developer track](https://hyperskill.org/onboarding) using [EduTools](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10081-edutools) plugin for [IDEA InteliJ IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).

Simple simulation of a coffee machine. The program allows user to select a coffee type and notifies via console the possibility of making selected coffee based on the amount of resources in the machine. The user can also check remaining supplies, fill the machine with resources and take out the money obtained for making a coffee.

[Detailed description](https://hyperskill.org/projects/33) of the project is available on JetBrains Academy website.

### Realisation of the project was divided into 6 stages:
- Stage #1. Printing basic information to the console output.
- Stage #2. Calculating resources needed for a coffee.
- Stage #3. Validating possibility of making a coffee based on user input.
- Stage #4. Creating user menus and adding possible input/output actions.
- Stage #5. Displaying machine's resources and realising actions in a loop updating machine's state.
- Stage #6. Optimizing the program logic.

### Main topics covered by this project
- variables, types, parameters
- printing output to the console
- loops and conditions
- defining methods
